Then just access it by URL like, for instance, `http://localhost/marknotes/install.php`.

Tadaaaa :tada:, it's done. Was easy no ?

Note : this script will ask you which version to download, the `master` version or the `development` one . Once your choice has been made, the script will download the latest version (as a zip file) of marknotes. Once downloaded, the zip file will be unzipped and if everything goes fine, both the zip and this install.php script will be removed during the finalization phase.
